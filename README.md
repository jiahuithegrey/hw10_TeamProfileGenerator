# Team Profile CLI Generator
* This is a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 
* When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 
* This CLI application passes all unit test.

## Built With
* OOP: constructors and prototype chain
* TDD (test driven-development)

## Development
* Integrate constructor functions into your applications, adding structure to your code and reducing the amount of code to write.
* Using OOP, separating data and functionality into different constructor functions that can be composed together.
* Verify your code works as intended through the use of automated tests by "npm run test"
* Build applications using test-driven-development, writing tests before implementing functionality.
